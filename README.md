Quick Tip (Align The Repo Cards)
By default, GitHub does not lay out the cards side by side. To do that, you can use this approach:

<a href="https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats">
  <img align="center" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=anuraghazra&repo=github-readme-stats" />

Deploy on your own

Warning If you are on the hobby (i.e. free) Vercel plan, please make sure you change the maxDuration parameter in the vercel.json file from 30 to 10 (see #1416 for more information).

Since the GitHub API only allows 5k requests per hour, my https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api could possibly hit the rate limiter. If you host it on your own Vercel server, then you do not have to worry about anything. Click on the deploy button to get started!

Note Since #58, we should be able to handle more than 5k requests and have fewer issues with downtime üòÅ.

On other platforms
Warning This way of using GRS is not officially supported and was added to cater to some particular use cases where Vercel could not be used (e.g. #2341). The support for this method, therefore, is limited.

Keep your fork up to date
You can keep your fork, and thus your private Vercel instance up to date with the upstream using GitHubs' Sync Fork button. You can also use the pull package created by @wei to automate this process.

üíñ Support the project
I open-source almost everything I can and try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously, this takes time. You can use this service for free.

However, if you are using this project and are happy with it or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are a few ways you can do it:

Giving proper credit when you use github-readme-stats on your readme, linking back to it :D
Starring and sharing the project üöÄ
